## This is the Landing Page. It's a very simple page just to build a bridge to the main page

## Website's link
* Once you click in the link you should wait 5 seconds until the data is loaded. If it doesn't load completely, reload the page. Then you can try this app as you wish.
* Should you have any inconvenience, please let me know.

## Project's Goals
- Build a Mini Storefront using **React class type component only, Redux, JavaScript, Node, MongoDB** and **GraphQL**.
- Use and practice all concepts related to HTML, CSS, Graphql queries, Mongo Atlas.
- Learn better **coding practices** and **NSQL** DB as **Mongo**.
- Practice **GIT's workflow**.

## Statement
The main idea was to create a simple storefront that would retrieve data from a fake DB, self loaded when thr BE server is run.

As a user you can:
- navigate among three categories: **All**, **Clothes** and **Tech**.
- select the currency you prefer.
- see your stored products by clicking in the cart icon.
- change the attributes of each product in the minicart deployable feature.
- buy passing the mouse over each image you can pick the product and add it to your cart with predefined attributes.
- buy clicking on the product's image the user can see relevant information about the product and change preferencies.
- reloading each page will show you what you where viewing before.
- the user can close the browser and come back later, founding that the selected products are still in the cart.
- products out off stock are shown but the user is not able to select them.

The DB is populated using a seeder that can be found in the API main folder, inside SRC folder:
- There are three categories predefined
- There are eight products predefined


## Technologies used:
- [ ] React

## How it works
* Clone this repository,
* MongoDB Compass should be runing,

* Run **npm start** in both folders Api and Client,
* Whait until http://localhost:3000 opens itself in your browser.
